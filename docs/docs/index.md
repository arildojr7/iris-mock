A kotlin-first tool to intercept android network calls, modify requests/responses and mock entire APIs. Also includes a cool DSL, that helps to reduce boilerplate code and simplify development.
<br><br>
btw, Iris is my daughter's name :smiling_face_with_3_hearts:

## Features
- Works with Retrofit, Volley and every libs that depend on OkHttp
- Allow intercept call on 3rd party libs
- [DSL](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/type-safe-builders.html){ target=_blank } to avoid boilerplate

## Why use iris mock?
- A centralized tool to log, intercept and modify requests/response
- As it works at bytecode level, can be used with 3rd party libs
- Compiler developed using [KSP](https://github.com/google/ksp){ target=_blank }, up to 2x faster than KAPT
- No need to do SSL things, like inject certificate

## Roadmap
- Add support to [Ktor](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor){ target=_blank }
- Expand DSL
- and many other cool things
