A kotlin tool to intercept android network calls, modify requests/responses and mock entire APIs. Also includes a cool DSL, that helps to reduce boilerplate code and simplify development.
<br><br>
btw, <b>Iris</b> is my daughter's name ðŸ¥°

## Features
- Works with Retrofit, Volley and other libs that depend on OkHttp
- Allow intercept call on 3rd-party libs
- [DSL](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/type-safe-builders.html) to avoid boilerplate

## Why use IrisMock?
- A centralized tool to log, intercept and modify requests/response
- No need to do SSL things, like inject certificate
- Simple and intuitive API
- Doesn't use reflection
- As it works at bytecode level, can be used with 3rd-party libs (plugin-only)

## Getting started

### #1 - IrisMock plugin
This is the default way of using IrisMock. Start by adding the plugin to your project:

```kotlin
// :app build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("dev.arildo.iris-mock-plugin") version "LATEST_VERSION"
}
```
<details>
  <summary>Using legacy plugin application - older gradle</summary>

```kotlin
// :app build.gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven {
          url = uri("https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/")
        }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("dev.arildo:iris-mock-plugin:LATEST_VERSION")
    }
}

apply(plugin = "dev.arildo.iris-mock-plugin")
```
</details>

Then create a class implementing the `Interceptor` interface and then use `irisMock(chain)` function:
```kotlin
class MyInterceptor : Interceptor {
    override fun intercept(chain: Interceptor.Chain) = irisMock(chain) {
        onGet(contains = "user/profile") mockResponse userProfileJson
        onPost(endsWith = "/login") {
            delay(2_000) // fake slow internet
            if (containsInRequestBody("validPassword")) mockResponse(successLoginJson)
            else mockResponse(errorPasswordJson)
        }
    }
}
```

Finally, we need to start IrisMock on application and pass the interceptors:
```kotlin
class MyApp : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        startIrisMock {
            enableLogs()
            interceptors(::MyInterceptor)
        }
    }
}
```
---
### #2 - IrisMock DSL
This way, the interceptors are __not__ injected on OkHttp, so you need to it by yourself. It's specially useful
if you already have interceptors on your project and want only benefit from using IrisMock DSL.

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
    implementation("dev.arildo:iris-mock:LATEST_VERSION")
}
```

then you can use `irisMock(chain)`, as shown previously.

See [official docs](https://irismock.arildo.dev/getting-started/configure-gradle/) for further details

## Roadmap
- Add support to [Ktor](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor)
- Expand DSL
